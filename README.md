### Description
Plugin management for Wordpress Multisite that supports the native plugins page. 
It uses a backend options page to adjust plugin permissions for all the sites in your network.

* Select what plugins sites have access to
* Choose plugins to Auto-Activate for all new blogs
* Mass activate/deactivate a plugin on all sites in your network (Very Handy!)
* Assign special plugin access permissions for specific sites in your network
* And as Super Admin, you can override all these to activate specific plugins on the sites you choose!
* Removes the plugin meta row links (Version, Author, Plugin) and any update messages for blog admins
